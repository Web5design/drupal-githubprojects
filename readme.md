# Github Projects

## Install

1. Copy this into your `{DRUPAL PATH}/sites/all/modules/githubprojects` directory. 
2. Open your modules tab and enable `Github Projects`. 
3. Click configure and paste a Github access token (from https://github.com/settings/applications).
4. Your nodes should now be populated.

## Usage

Every hour the plugin will import all your github projects as nodes. This allows you to list and link to their pages locally.
